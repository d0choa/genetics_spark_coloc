# Roadmap

The Open Targets core team is working on refactoring Open Targets Genetics, aiming to:

- Re-focusing the product around Target ID
- Creating a gold standard toolkit for post-GWAS analysis
- Faster/robust addition of new datasets and datatypes
- Reducing computational and financial cost

See [here](https://github.com/opentargets/issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AGenetics_ETL_refactoring) for a list of open issues for this project.
