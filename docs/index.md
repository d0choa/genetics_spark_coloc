Open Targets Gentropy is a Python package to facilitate the interpretation and analysis of GWAS and functional genomic studies for target identification. The package contains a toolkit for the harmonisation, statistical analysis and prioritisation of genetic signals to assist drug discovery.

## About Open Targets

Open Targets is a pre-competitive, public-private partnership that uses human genetics and genomics data to systematically identify and prioritise drug targets. Through large-scale genomic experiments and the development of innovative computational techniques, the partnership aims to help researchers select the best targets for the development of new therapies. For more information, visit the Open Targets [website](https://www.opentargets.org).
