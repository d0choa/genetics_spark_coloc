# Data Source

This section contains information about the data sources used in Open Targets Gentropy.

We use GnomAD v4.0 as a source for variant annotation and GnomAD v2.1.1 as a source for linkage disequilibrium (LD) information (described in the **GnomAD** section).

We rely on Open Targets as a source for the list of targets and the Gold Standard training set (described in the **Open Targets** section).

## Study Sources

1. GWAS catalog
2. FinnGen

## Molecular QTLs

1. eQTL catalogue

## Interaction / Interval-based Experiments

We integrate a list of studies that focus on interaction and interval-based investigations, shedding light on the intricate relationships between genetic elements and their functional implications. For more detils see section **"Intervals"**.
