The [eQTL Catalogue](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl/) aims to provide uniformly processed gene expression and splicing Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) from all available public studies on humans.

It serves as the ultimate resource of eQTLs that we use for colocalization and target prioritization.

We utilize data from the following study within the eQTL Catalogue:

1. **GTEx v8**, 49 tissues
