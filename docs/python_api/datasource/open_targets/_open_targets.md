The Open Targets Platform is a comprehensive resource that aims to aggregate and harmonise various types of data to facilitate the identification, prioritisation, and validation of drug targets. By integrating publicly available datasets including data generated by the Open Targets consortium, the Platform builds and scores target-disease associations to assist in drug target identification and prioritisation. It also integrates relevant annotation information about targets, diseases, phenotypes, and drugs, as well as their most relevant relationships.

Genomic data from Open Targets integrates human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and functional genomics data including gene expression, protein abundance, chromatin interaction and conformation data from a wide range of cell types and tissues to make robust connections between GWAS-associated loci, variants and likely causal genes.
